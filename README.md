## Overview

The **CGPA Calculator** is a simple and efficient command-line application that allows students to calculate their **Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)**. It uses the grades and credit hours of the courses taken by the student to compute the CGPA, applying a weighted average method. The tool is designed to be user-friendly, customizable to different grading scales, and capable of handling any number of courses.

This project aims to assist students in easily tracking and calculating their academic performance without manually doing the complex calculations.

## Features

- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: A simple command-line interface where users input grades and credit hours.
- **Weighted Average Calculation**: Calculates the CGPA based on both grades and the respective credit hours of each course.
- **Customizable Grading Scale**: Supports different grading scales (e.g., 4.0, 5.0), and can be easily modified to fit the grading system used by the institution.
- **Flexible Course Entry**: Users can input data for any number of courses, allowing for flexibility depending on their academic schedule.
- **Real-Time Output**: Displays the calculated CGPA instantly after all inputs are provided.
